## Internal function are faster

Function   defined  internally   are  sometimes   incredibly  faster (written in \texttt{C}), but cannot  by called in packages submitted to CRAN.

```{r do_internal}
x <- rnorm(100)
res <- microbenchmark(mean = mean(x),
                      mine = sum(x)/length(x),
                      internal = .Internal(mean(x)), times = 1e+05)
```

```{r do_internal_plot, echo = FALSE, out.width='.7\\textwidth'}
autoplot(res)
```
