## Function definition

### Syntax

```{r function_definition, eval = FALSE}

my_func <- function(arg1,arg2, ...) {
  expression
}
```

### Remarks 
-  The last value of the expression is returned
-  One must use a list to send  back several objects
- `return()` is used only when you need to send a value at an early stage
-  In `R`, functions are object like any others and can manipulated as such

## Function components {.allowframebreaks}

Most of functions have three parts

- the `body()` (code inside the function)
- the `formals()` (list of arguments)
- the `environment()` (a set of bindings between symbols and objects, i.e, a place to store variables)

```{r function_components}
environment(var)
formals(var)
body(var)
```
