## Primitive functions: definition

- Primitive functions are functions from the `base` package that call `C` code directly
- Primitive functions  do not contain `R` code, as so

```{r primitive_empty}
sum
formals(sum)
body(sum)
environment(sum)
```

## Primitive functions: performance

Function defined internally (either with `.Primitive` either called via `.Internal`)   are  sometimes incredibly  faster (written in \texttt{C}), but cannot by called directly in packages submitted to CRAN.

```{r do_internal}
x <- rnorm(100)
R_mean <- function(x) mean(x)
my_mean <- function(x) sum(x)/length(x)
internal_mean <- function(x) .Internal(mean(x))
```

```{r do_internal_plot, echo = FALSE, out.width='.65\\textwidth'}
res <- microbenchmark(R_mean = mean(x),
                      my_mean = sum(x)/length(x),
                      internal_mean = .Internal(mean(x)), times = 1e+05)
autoplot(res)
```
