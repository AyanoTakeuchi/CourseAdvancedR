## {magrittr}

![a set of operators which make your code more readable](../Rmd_files/tidyverse/figs/hex-magrittr.png){width=100px}

```{r libmagrittr}
library(magrittr)
```

Provides the following operators

  - Pipe  `%>%`
  - Reassignment pipe  `%<>%`
  - T-Pipe  `%T>%`

## Motivation: make Tom eat an apple

### Everyday language
> Tom eats an apple

Subject - Verb - Complement

### Programming language

> `eat(Tom, apple)`

Verb - Subject - Complement

### Pipes

\rsa get closer to everyday language in your code

\rsa clearly expressing a sequence of multiple operations


## Pipe  `%>%`

- when you read code, `%>%` is pronounced "then" 
- the keybord shortcut for `%>%` is Ctrl + shift + M

### Objective
- Helps writing `R` code which is easy to read (and thus, easy to understand)

- `x %>% f()` is equivalent to `f(x)`
- `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`
- `x %>% f(y,.)` is Ã©quivalent to `f(y,x)`

\pause 

### Example

```{r nopipe}
2^mean(log(seq_len(10), base = 2), na.rm = TRUE)
```

\pause

```{r pipe}
10 %>% 
  seq_len() %>% 
  log(base = 2) %>% 
  mean(na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  {2^.}
```

## Exercise

Consider
```{r exercise_pipe}
x <- c(0.109, 0.359, 0.63, 0.996, 0.515, 0.142, 0.017, 0.829, 0.907)
```

Compute the logarithm of `x`, return suitably lagged and iterated differences, compute the exponential function and round the result

1. In base `R`
2. Using `%>%` 


## (Re)assignment pipe  `%<>%`

For affectation, `magrittr` provides the operator `%<>%` which allows to replace code like
``` {r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars <- mtcars%>% transform(cyl = cyl * 2)
```

by
```{r, eval=FALSE}
mtcars %<>% transform(cyl = cyl * 2)
```

## T-pipe `%T>%` 

### Problem with functions requiring early side effects along succession of `%>%` 
  - you might want to plot or print and object
  - such function do not send back anything and break the pipe

### Solution
  - to overcome such an issue, use the "tee"  pipe `%T>%` 
  - works like `%>%`  except that it sends left side in place of right side of the expression 
  - "tee"because it looks like a pipe with a T shape

## T-pipe `%T>%`: example without T

```{r pipeT1, fig.cap = "plot of bivariate Gaussian sample"}
    rnorm (100) %>%
      matrix(ncol = 2) %>%
      plot() %>%
      str()
``` 

##  T-pipe `%T>%`: example with T

```{r pipeT2, fig.cap = "plot of bivariate Gaussian sample"} 
    rnorm (100) %>%
      matrix(ncol = 2) %T>%
      plot() %>%
      str()
```

##  Exposition Operator `%$%`

When working with functions that do not take data argumentbut still useful in a pipeline, e.g., when your data is first processed and then passed into the function.

### Example
```{r pipe_exposing}
iris %>%
  subset(Sepal.Length > mean(Sepal.Length)) %$%
  cor(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
```

##  When not to use the pipe

Consider other solutions when

### Pipes contain too many steps
Create _intermediate_ objects with meaningful names

### Multiple inputs or outputs are required 
E.g., when several objects need to _combine_ together

### Complex dependance structures exists between your entries
Pipes are fundamentally _linear_: expressing complex relationships with them yield confusing code.
