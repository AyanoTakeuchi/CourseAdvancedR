## Tidy data: motivation

Collected data are (never) under a proper canonical format

## Tidy data: what

### First, a subjective question
What is the observation/statistical unit in your data?

### Definition

Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## tidy data: why? 

![Tidy data](../Rmd_files/tidyverse/figs/tidy_data.png)

 - make manipulation, visualization and modelling easier
 - a common structure for all packages
 - a design philosophy for datat representation beyond `R` 

## Tidy vs non tidy: example I
 
```{r show_non_tidy1}
print(tidyr::table3)
```

## Tidy vs non tidy: example II
 
```{r show_non_tidy2}
tidyr::table2
```

## Tidy vs non tidy: example III
 
```{r show_tidy}
tidyr::table1
```
