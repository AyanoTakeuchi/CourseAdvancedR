## The secret function `rowsum` {.allowframebreaks}

`rowsum` (not to  be confused with `rowSums`) computes sums  in a  vector split  according  a grouping  variable (work  for matrices).

```{r rowsum_ex}
vec <- runif(1000)
grp <- sample(1:5, 1000, TRUE)
print(c(rowsum(vec, grp)))
```

There are many possibilities to perform the required task:

```{r}
res <- microbenchmark(
 rowsum = rowsum(vec, grp),
 split  = sapply(split(vec, grp), sum),
 tapply = tapply(vec, grp, sum),
 aggreg = aggregate(vec, list(grp), sum),
times = 1000)
```

```{r rowsum_plot, echo = FALSE}
autoplot(res)
```
