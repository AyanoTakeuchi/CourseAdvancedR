## Functional programming: general idea

### Definition
`R` is _a Functional programming language_ with _first class functions_:  it places functions at the same level  as variables. One can

1. _pass functions as arguments_ to other functions
2. _return functions_ from other functions
3. _store functions in data structures_

### Ingredients
In `R` the tools/ingredients allowing functional programming are 

- _closure_, i.e. functions that output functions
- _list_, in which you can store functions
- _anonymous functions_, i.e. function that does not deserve a name
- _functionals_, i.e. functions that take function(s) as input
