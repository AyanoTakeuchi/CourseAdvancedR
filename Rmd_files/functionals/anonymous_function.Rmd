## Anonymous function

### Definition
A function that does not deserve a name, defined 'on the fly' during its use
```{r anonymous_syntax_equivalent}
(function(x) (x^2))(2)
f <- function(x) {x^2}
f(2)
```

### Remark
- generally very short with few arguments
- it style owns an environment, formals and body:

```{r}
formals(function(x) (x^2))
body(function(x) (x^2))
environment(function(x) (x^2))
```

- mostly used in conjunction with functionals
